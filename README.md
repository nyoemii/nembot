~~(anything < python 3.12 breaks i do not know why... it's the GSI library tho :3)~~

no this doesn't read memory it's not a cheat, i'm just using fucking [schizo methods](https://github.com/Pandaptable/CS-dotfiles/tree/main/selfbot/ticks) of sending console commands (exec_async with `n` getting executed every 50 frames that is aliased to `exec selfbot`)

## Setup
1. `uv sync`
2. `cp config_default.py config.py`
3. edit config
4. setup CS CFG folder and launch options
	- add the selfbot folder from [this](https://github.com/Pandaptable/CS-dotfiles) repo into your cfg folder
	- add `alias n "exec selfbot.cfg"` into your autoexec (or whatever you named the file at the root of your cfg directory)
	- add `exec "selfbot/setup.cfg"` into your autoexec (in main menu, it needs `sv_cheats 1` so it will break otherwise)
	- add `gamestate_integration_GSI.cfg` to the root of your cfg folder and use the same auth token you set in config
 	- add `-condebug` and `-conclearlog` to your launch options. (i'd also recommend adding `-allow_third_party_software` as i may implement something with window handles, which could possibly cause issues?)
 	- highly recommend adding`log_flags InputService +donotecho` to the end of your autoexec :3
5. download the [steamworks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/list) dll for version 1.61
7. install the game Fish (steam://install/3073680) to properly get the SteamAPI to initialize (nembot uses steamworks), you dont have to run it
8. `uv run main.py`
9. :trollface:
